### Ignoring Files
Csharpier will ignore the following files
- Any file that begins with ```TemporaryGeneratedFile_```
- Any file that ends with ```.designer.cs```
- Any file that ends with ```.generated.cs```
- Any file that ends with ```.g.cs```
- Any file that ends with ```.g.i.cs```
- Any file that begins with a comment that contains ```<autogenerated``` or ```<auto-generated```

Add a ```.csharpierignore``` file to ignore additional files and folders. The file uses [gitignore syntax](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format)

Example
```
Uploads/
**/App_Data/*.cs
```
